Performing ALL The sql operations 
Part2:
2. Add the constraint to check that the appointment date is not in the past.
3. List all the patients with older than 40 and have Cancer in diagnosis.
4. The hospital also requires stored procedures or user-defined functions to do the 
following things:
a) Search the database of the hospital for matching character strings by name of 
medicine. Results should be sorted with most recent medicine prescribed date first. 
b) Return a full list of diagnosis and allergies for a specific patient who has an
appointment today (i.e., the system date when the query is run)
c) Update the details for an existing doctor
d) Delete the appointment who status is already completed.
5. The hospitals wants to view the appointment date and time, showing all previous
and current appointments for all doctors, and including details of the department 
(the doctor is associated with), doctor’s specialty and any associate review/feedback 
given for a doctor. You should create a view containing all the required information.

6. Create a trigger so that the current state of an appointment can be changed to 
available when it is cancelled.
7. Write a select query which allows the hospital to identify the number of 
completed appointments with the specialty of doctors as ‘Gastroenterologists’.
8. Within your report, you will also need to provide your client with advice and guidance on:
• Data integrity and concurrency
• Database security
• Database backup and recovery
Generic information on these topics, which is not applied to the given scenario, is likely to 
score poorly.
To get more than a satisfactory mark, you must use all of the below at least once in your 
database:
• Views
• Stored procedures
• System functions and user defined functions
• Triggers
• SELECT queries which make use of joins and sub-queries
